        "# EE 467 Homework 1: Twitter Spam Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the first homework of EE 467! Here we will apply the ML pipline introduced in the second lab to **Twitter spam message detection problems**. In the past few years, social medias like Twitter has become the target of spam posting. Automatic spam posts can not only affect user experience, but they can also spread misinformation and subtly affect public opinions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this homework, we will work on a mini Twitter message dataset extracted from the CRESCI-2017 dataset. This dataset contains 50000 Twitter messages, half of which are sent by real Twitter users and half of which generated by spam bots. Your task is to train classifiers that can tell these two kinds of messages apart. This time, you'll go deeper and try multiple feature extractors and classifiers. Like the labs, you will need to fill out blanks in code cells. You are also going to answer a few questions and **optionally** work on improvements to existing pipeline completely on your own.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Before You Start\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You can discuss on Slack if you have questions and want to seek help; however, please try your best to **limit the scope of your question** and **avoid asking directly for answers**. You should also **avoid copy-pasting answers and code** from others.\n",
        "2. You **may use AI assistants** (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) to support your work. If you do, you must **clearly acknowledge** this by stating:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The name of the AI assistant**, and  \n",
        "- **How it was used** (e.g., brainstorming, clarifying concepts, debugging, editing, generating examples)\n",
        "\n",
        "You **must not copy and paste** AI-generated content directly into your submission without **fully understanding** what it does and being able to **explain it in your own words**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. You can **optionally work on this homework with one other student of this course as a team**, but **each of you needs to submit the homework individually**. If you choose to form a group, please include the name of your teammate here: _(Name of your teammate)_.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Feature Extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "We will begin our ML pipeline with feature extraction in this homework, as the dataset is good enough and does not need any special pre-processing. As usual, we will load the dataset into memory, extract samples features into vectors and split the dataset into training and test sets."

        "  The TF-IDF value for the bigram \"are good\" is 0. This happens because \"are good\" appears in all three messages, giving it a document frequency equal to the total number of documents. In the IDF calculation, this results in log(3/3) = log(1) = 0, which when multiplied by the term frequency gives a TF-IDF of 0. Since the bigram occurs in every message, it does not help distinguish one message from another so it has no weight as a discriminative feature.\n",
        "  5. If we consider unigram (1-gram) based bag of words, how many words in these three messages would be assigned a 0 value tf-idf? And please explain why.\n",
        "  If we consider a unigram-based bag-of-words representation, two words — \"are\" and \"good\" — would have a TF-IDF of 0 across all messages. This is because these words appear in every message, giving them a document frequency equal to the total number of documents. As a result, their IDF is zero, and multiplying by their term frequency gives TF-IDF = 0. Words that appear in all documents carry no information that differentiates one document from another, so TF-IDF appropriately assigns them zero weight."

It represents how many true samples belong to a particular class, regardless of how the model predicted them. Support is important because it provides context for the other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score; classes with higher support contribute more to the overall performance measures, while classes with very few samples may lead to less reliable metrics. Support tells you the size of each class in the dataset and helps interpret the balance of your data."

        "If the training data is highly unbalanced, accuracy is not a reliable metric, because a classifier could predict only the majority class and still appear highly accurate. A high accuracy does not necessarily imply a high F1-score, since F1 balances precision and recall, reflecting how well the model identifies positive cases. Compared to accuracy, F1-score is more informative for unbalanced datasets. Therefore, a classifier with a higher F1-score is generally better, as it performs well on both majority and minority classes rather than just favoring the majority."
